This is an idea for the layout of seis_tools:

ses3d:
	seismograms
	receiver_functions
        record_section
	rotate_setup

axisem:
	seismograms
	record_section

decon:
	water_level
	damped_lstsq
	pulse_stripping

velocity_conversion:
	read
	write_ses3d
	write_axisem_sph

seispy:
       various tools for plotting and manipulating obspy streams
